# my_portfolio
/*The site was created for portfolio presentation. It is easy to find the main sections about work and available design projects, as well as to contact the designer. 
There is a quick opportunity to write a letter, as well as visit the shop-section. If there is a need to get to know the person informally, there are links to social networks. The site can be improved and filled with links to other pages, but overall it is minimalistic.

For convenience, there is also a mobile version.*/
